      <p>For more information about the project <a href="">visit the project wiki on Confluence</a> (login required).</p>
      <p>This prototype is a digitised example of the pension opt out form (SD502) built for the dentistry discovery project. We have taken the PDF form and built a web example of it using the NHS prototyping toolkit and digital service manual guidelines.</p>
      <p>The form uses "branching" logic to separate the user into the required part section.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Part 1 - Employee (<a href="https://bsa2468.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/DSE/pages/2882765554/Performer+1+-+Majority+user">Performer user persona</a>)</li>
        <li>Part 2 - Employer (<a href="https://bsa2468.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/DSE/pages/2886500483/Practice+Manager" >Practice Manager user persona</a>)</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Part 1 relates to the Performer user persona. Part 2 relates to the Practice Manager user persona.</p>
      <p>It is envisaged that the form would be completed initially by the employee. Upon completion an email with a reference would be sent to the employer payroll department (we understand from our research that this could be a Practice Manager and so this information would need to be captured in Compass). Within this email would be a reference code that the payroll department would use to complete their part of the form.</p>
      <p>Once both employer and employee have completed their forms, the BSA would be notified of a completed application and process the form either automatically with a random selection for auditing and security or manually.</p>
      <p>The intention of digitising this form is to show during the discovery phase of the project, how this process could work and how it could be scaled up to meet the requirement of putting the FP17 form through the NHS digital service approach.</p>
